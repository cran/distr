#  News: to package distr 
######################################################################


##############
v 1.8
##############


* Class DExp() introduced (with documentation)
* show() for UnivariateDistribution now is the same as print()
* dim() method for UnivariateDistribution 
* distr (together with distrEx, distrSim, distrTEst) now includes a vignette --- try 
  vignette("distr")

##############
v 1.7
##############


* standardMethods() is again included (with documentation)
* distroptions() / getdistrOption() now behave exactly like options()  / getOption() options --- also compare mail
  "Re: [Rd] How to implement package-specific options?" by Brian Ripley on
  r-devel, Fri 09 Dec 2005 - 11:52:46, see http://tolstoy.newcastle.edu.au/R/devel/05/12/3408.html
* suggested by M. Maechler: on attaching the package there is a (sort of) 
  warning as to the interpretation of 
    +arithmetics for distributions
  as well as to the
    +accuracy of slots p,d,q filled by means of simulations; 
  these warnings are issued at two places:
      (1) on attaching the package 
      (2) at every show/print of a distribution
      o (2) can be cancelled by switching off a corresponding global option in distroptions() -- see ?distroptions . 
* all specific distributions (those realized as [r|d|p|q]<name> like rnorm in package stats)
  now have valid prototypes
* fixed arguments xlim and ylim for plot(signature("AbscontDistribution" or "DiscreteDistribution"))
  thus: plot(Cauchy(),xlim=c(-4,4)) gives reasonable result (and plot(Cauchy()) does not)
* Internationalization: use of gettext, gettextf for output
* explicitly implemented is() relations:  R "knows" that
      o an Exponential(lambda) distribution also is a Weibull(shape = 1, scale = 1/lambda) distribution, as well as a Gamma(shape = 1, scale = 1/lambda) distribution
      o a Uniform(0,1) distribution also is a Beta(1,1) distribution
      o a Cauchy(0,1) distribution also is a T(df=1, ncp=0)  distribution
      o a Chisq(df=n, ncp=0) distribution also is a Gamma(shape=n/2, scale=2) distribution
* noncentrality parameter included for Beta, T, F distribution 
* exact +,* for Cauchy and Dirac, for latter also -,/


* "simplifyr": changed default values (using option RtoDPQ.e) 
* masking of function sd from stats to have an additional ... argument 
* masking of function df from stats to have an additional ... argument 

* Internationalization: use of gettext, gettextf in output

* updated citation file

* noncentrality parameter included for Beta, Td, F (for new d,p,q,r, but compatible with 2.2.x)
  also in the documentation

* Geom is now subclass of Nbinom
* virtual superclass ExpOrGammaOrChisq for Chisq,Exp,Gammad
* NEWS file
* commented ARITHMETICS file
* revised help for operators
* new package documentation distr-package.Rd

##############
v 1.6 
##############

Our package is reorganized:
  * distr from now on only comprises distribution classes and methods
  * simulation classes and methods have been moved to the new package distrSim
  * evalation classes and methods have been moved to the new package distrTEst
  * a new class distrEx has been added by Matthias Kohl, providing additional features 
    like distances between distributions, expectation operators etc
  * a new class RandVar has been added by Matthias Kohl, providing conceptual treatment 
    of random variables as measurable mappings

##############
v 1.5 
##############

* package is now using lazy loading
* minor changes in the help pages
* minor enhancements in plot for distributions (Gamma, discrete distributions)
* package now includes a demo - folder; try demo("distr")
* class Gamma has been renamed Gammad to avoid name collisions
* we have a CITATION file now; consider citation("distr")
* enhanced demos:
      + convolution of uniform variables now includes exact expressions
      + min/ max of two variables now available for discrete distributions
* rd-Files have now a keyword entry for distribution and thus may be found by the search engine
* exact formula for "Unif" o "numeric" where o \in { +,-,*,/ }

##############
v 1.4 
##############

* to avoid name collisions with short forms for TRUE and FALSE: classes T and F (T- and F-distributions) renamed to Td and Fd
* package is now loaded as a binary => considerable speed gain
* using subsititute the bodies of the r,d,p,q-function-slots distributions show the parameter values with which they were generated
* convolutions and applications of the math group may now be traced in r-slot of a distribution object, compare
       r(sin(Norm()) + cos(Unif() * 3 + 2))
* parameters of a distribution (mean, sd, etc) are now tested on length 1
    + we see the objects as implementations of univaritate distributions, so vectors make no sense here; 
      rather one could gather several objects with possibly different parameters to a vector of distributions. 
      Of course, the original functions rnorm etc remain unchanged and still allow for vector-valued parameters.
* Classes "Parameter", "Distribution" , "UnivariateDistribution" are no longer VIRTUAL
* "AbscontParameter" and "DiscreteParameter" are replaced by "Parameter"
* type of slots d, p, q and param changed to "OptionalFunction" and "OptionalParameter", respectively
 
##############
v 1.3 
##############

* changes in the Help-File to pass Rcmd check

##############
v 1.1 
##############

* implementation of further exact convolution formulae for distributions Nbinom, Gamma, Exp, Chisq
* exact formulae for scale transformations for the distributions Gamma, Exp
* slot "seed" in simulation classes is now controlled and set via the setRNG package by Paul Gilbert
